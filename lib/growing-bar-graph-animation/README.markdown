# Growing bar graph animation

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/bretteast/pen/RWMaqW](https://codepen.io/bretteast/pen/RWMaqW).

This is just a really simple bar graph that animates by moving full-height bars up from the bottom of the svg container.
It is still pretty manual, in that you have to enter the heights for all the bars, and create all the animations, although there is an SCSS mixin that makes the creation of the animations a little easier.
